# JavaScript Basics - Arithmetic, Assignment, Comparison, Logical, and Ternary Operators

This README provides code snippets and explanations for fundamental JavaScript operations, including arithmetic operations, assignment operators, comparison operators, logical operators, and the ternary operator.

## Activity 1: Arithmetic Operations

### Task 1: Add Two Numbers
```javascript
let num1 = 10;
let num2 = 5;
let sum = num1 + num2;
console.log("Sum:", sum); // Output: Sum: 15
```

In this task, we add two numbers and log the result to the console.

### Task 2: Subtract Two Numbers
```javascript
let num1 = 10;
let num2 = 5;
let difference = num1 - num2;
console.log("Difference:", difference); // Output: Difference: 5
```

This task demonstrates how to subtract two numbers and log the result.

### Task 3: Multiply Two Numbers
```javascript
let num1 = 10;
let num2 = 5;
let product = num1 * num2;
console.log("Product:", product); // Output: Product: 50
```

Here, we multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.

### Task 4: Divide Two Numbers
```javascript
let num1 = 10;
let num2 = 5;
let quotient = num1 / num2;
console.log("Quotient:", quotient); // Output: Quotient: 2
```

This task involves dividing two numbers and logging the result.

### Task 5: Find the Remainder
```javascript
let num1 = 10;
let num2 = 3;
let remainder = num1 % num2;
console.log("Remainder:", remainder); // Output: Remainder: 1
```

In this task, we find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result.

## Activity 2: Assignment Operators

### Task 6: Use `+=` Operator
```javascript
let num = 10;
num += 5;
console.log("Updated Number:", num); // Output: Updated Number: 15
```

This task shows how to use the `+=` operator to add a number to a variable and log the result.

### Task 7: Use `-=` Operator
```javascript
let num = 10;
num -= 3;
console.log("Updated Number:", num); // Output: Updated Number: 7
```

Here, we use the `-=` operator to subtract a number from a variable and log the result.

## Activity 3: Comparison Operators

### Task 8: Compare Two Numbers Using `>` and `<`
```javascript
let a = 10;
let b = 5;
console.log(a > b); // Output: true
console.log(a < b); // Output: false
```

In this task, we compare two numbers using the greater than (`>`) and less than (`<`) operators.

### Task 9: Compare Two Numbers Using `>=` and `<=`
```javascript
let a = 10;
let b = 10;
console.log(a >= b); // Output: true
console.log(a <= b); // Output: true
```

This task demonstrates how to compare two numbers using the greater than or equal to (`>=`) and less than or equal to (`<=`) operators.

### Task 10: Compare Two Numbers Using `==` and `===`
```javascript
let a = 10;
let b = "10";
console.log(a == b);  // Output: true (checks value only)
console.log(a === b); // Output: false (checks value and type)
```

Here, we compare two numbers using the equality (`==`) and strict equality (`===`) operators.

## Activity 4: Logical Operators

### Task 11: Use `&&` Operator
```javascript
let age = 25;
let hasLicense = true;
console.log(age > 18 && hasLicense); // Output: true
```

This task shows how to use the `&&` operator to combine two conditions and log the result.

### Task 12: Use `||` Operator
```javascript
let age = 16;
let hasLicense = false;
console.log(age > 18 || hasLicense); // Output: false
```

In this task, we use the `||` operator to combine two conditions and log the result.

### Task 13: Use `!` Operator
```javascript
let isRaining = true;
console.log(!isRaining); // Output: false
```

Here, we use the `!` operator to negate a condition and log the result.

## Activity 5: Ternary Operator

### Task 14: Check if a Number is Positive or Negative
```javascript
let number = -5;
let result = (number >= 0) ? "Positive" : "Negative";
console.log(result); // Output: Negative
```

This task demonstrates how to use the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative and log the result.
